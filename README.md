## 🛡️ Safety Check System

Ziply uses a dual-layer security approach to ensure link safety:

### 1️⃣ AI-Based Analysis
Powered by **Google Gemini AI**, it evaluates:
- URL structure & potential deceptive patterns.
- Domain reputation and registration age.
- Contextual intent to provide a detailed risk explanation.

### 2️⃣ Heuristic Detection
A fast rule-based system that flags:
- **Suspicious TLDs**: `.zip`, `.click`, `.top`, etc.
- **Punycode (IDN)**: Spoofing attempts using international characters.
- **Direct IP-based URLs**: Attempts to bypass domain-based security filters.

### 🚨 Flag Handling
Risky links are marked as **“Pending Review”**. Users receive a clear, detailed explanation of why the link was flagged, helping prevent the spread of phishing and malicious content.

## 💡 Why Ziply?
Unlike traditional URL shorteners, Ziply prioritizes **security + transparency**, ensuring users not only shorten links—but also understand the risks behind them.
